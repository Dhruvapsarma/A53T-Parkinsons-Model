# A53T-Parkinsons-Model
A Multi-Scale Computational Model of Parkinson's Disease (A53T Mutation)

# Overview
This repository contains a multi-scale simulation framework that models how the A53T mutation in alpha-synuclein leads to Parkinsonian pathophysiology, spanning across:

* Atomic-scale structural disruption

* Molecular aggregation and membrane affinity

* Cellular oxidative stress and dopamine loss

* Circuit-level oscillations and firing rate collapse

* System-level symptom mapping and therapy prediction

Developed for **IRIS National Science Fair 2025 (Translational Medicine Category)**.

# Features

* Full Google Colab–compatible notebook

* Integrated 3D structure visualization (Py3Dmol)

* Multi-scale simulation across various biological layers

* Validation vs literature values

* Therapeutic target scoring across scales

* Sensitivity analysis of dopamine reduction
